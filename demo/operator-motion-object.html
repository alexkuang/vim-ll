  Now for a demo using (IMO) one of the most PITA languages to edit, HTML!
  
  Suppose you are a 1337 hacker charged with defacing the site of a 90s-style shopping portal.  You come across the
  following monstrosity of HTML, and you wish to:
    - Properly indent it; you're a hacker, not a barbarian
    - Change the id of the div to "inventory-old
    - Change the classes of each li to "bar" to mess up their styling
    - Upcase all the individual items

  A good way to accomplish this would be:
    - `=G` to format to end of file
    - Go to the inventory line, `f"ci"inventory-old`
    - Go to li line, `f"ci"bar<ESC>j.j.j.` (etc)
    - Go back to first li line, `fIgUitj.j.j.` (etc)

  Another tedious task, made easier by vim!  Now you can go back to hanging around on IRC and playing LoL.

<div id="inventory">
<ul>
<li class="bar">Item 1</li>
<li class="foo">Item 2</li>
<li class="foo">Item 3</li>
<li class="foo">Item 4</li>
<li class="foo">Item 5</li>
<li class="foo">Item 6</li>
</ul>
</div>
