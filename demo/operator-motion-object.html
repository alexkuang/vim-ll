  Now for a demo using (IMO) one of the most PITA languages to edit, HTML!
  
  Suppose you are a 1337 hacker charged with defacing the site of a 90s-style shopping portal.  You come across the
  following monstrosity of HTML, and you wish to:
    - Properly indent it; you're a hacker, not a barbarian
    - Change the id of the div to "inventory-old"
    - Change the classes of each li to "bar" to further mess up their styling
    - Upcase all the individual items

  A good way to accomplish this would be:
    - `=G` to format to end of file
    - Go to the inventory line, `f"ci"inventory-old<ESC>`
    - Go to li line, `f"ci"bar<ESC>j.j.j.` (etc)
    - Go back to first li line, `fIgUitj.j.j.` (etc)

  Another tedious task, made easier by vim!  Now you can go back to hanging around on IRC and playing LoL.

<div id="inventory-old">
<ul>
<li class="foo">Expensive Item 1</li>
<li class="foo">Expensive Item 2</li>
<li class="foo">Expensive Item 3</li>
<li class="foo">Expensive Item 4</li>
<li class="foo">Expensive Item 5</li>
<li class="foo">Expensive Item 6</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!--
  Extended explanation for the above:
  - =G -> format till end of file
  - f" -> go to next occurrence of "
  - ci"inventory-old<ESC> -> change everything in the quotes to inventory-old, then back to normal mode
  - j.j.j.(etc) -> j: move down, .: repeat last operation
  - fI -> go to next occurrence of I
  - gUit -> upcase everything inside the (t)ags
  - j.j.j.(etc) -> same as above
