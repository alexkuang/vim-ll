### About

This is my "lunch and learn" presentation for work.  My goal here is to start spreading the gospel of vim.

Still very much WIP, take it with a grain of salt.

### Running

To run locally, use `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` then hit up `localhost:8000` for the crazy reveal.js magic.

Alternately, some trailing branch of master will be running off github pages at: http://alexkuang.github.io/vim-ll

### Demos

It's really silly (and kind of futile) to give a live talk about vim and _not_ do any demos.  I'll try to make the demo
files as free-standing as possible and annotate the keys I plan on using with `code backticks`, but no promises, since
this _is_ a live presentation...  Nevertheless, all pertinent files will be in the demos folder in the project.  Moments
where I plan on jumping from the slides to a demo will be denoted in code-style text highlighted in red.

### Lunch 'n Learn?

Every week at work our dev team has a "lunch and learn" presentation.  This is a series of 1h talks in which developers
take turns teaching topics of their choice, technical or not.  I originally wrote this for my presentation, but maybe
kinda sorta perhaps someone on the internet will find it useful?
