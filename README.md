This is my "lunch and learn" presentation for work.  It's meant to be a 1h quick talk on vim.

Still very much WIP, take it with a grain of salt.

Run with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

### TODO
- Finish most important part of presentation--Vim's grammar, `action-motion-object`
- demo text files
- Mention "unix as an ide" concept, comparison with traditional ides
- Misc cool demo ideas:
    - :h filter / :h ! (a la acme) (/ expression register?)
