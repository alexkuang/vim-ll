### About

This is my "lunch and learn" presentation for work.  My goal here is to start spreading the gospel of vim.

Still very much WIP, take it with a grain of salt.

### Running

Run with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`, and then hit up `localhost:8080` for the crazy reveal.js magic.

### Demos

It's really silly (and kind of futile) to give a live talk about vim and _not_ do any demos.  I'll try to make the demo
files as free-standing as possible and annotate the keys I plan on using with `code backticks`, but no promises...

### Lunch 'n Learn?

Every week at work our dev team has a "lunch and learn" presentation.  This is a series of 1h talks in which developers
take turns teaching topics of their choice, technical or not.  I originally wrote this for my presentation, but maybe
kinda sorta perhaps someone on the internet will find it useful?
